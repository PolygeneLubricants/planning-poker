# Just Planning Poker
Just Planning Poker is a simple lightweight planning poker web application. It runs in-memory, and thus only requires a web application to host and run the tool.

It is written in .Net 6, using [Blazor WebAssembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-6.0#blazor-webassembly).

It is designed to supplement face-to-face planning poker, since many development teams are often working remotely, following the global pandemic that resulted in office shut-downs in most of the world.
